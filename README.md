Just a silly side project before school starts. I've been playing a lot of Pokemon and often have to google type match ups. So I am working on this small command line program to quickly tell you what pokemon will give you the best advange against a certain type.

SETUP for Mac:
	Download PokemonTypes.py
	In the Terminal, change into the directory that you downloaded the file
	Run "python PokemonTypes.py"
